        <h3 class="mt-3">About this site...</h3>
        <p>This site is managed and maintained by Stuart Maxwell, but the checks are based on the amazing work by <a href="https://github.com/mxsasha">Sasha Romijn</a> for the Pony Checkup site that she ran for over 8 years.</p>
        <p>While the Pony Checkup site was around for years and processed ~28,000 checks, this site is still in its infancy but we have lots of ideas about how it can improved and developed over time.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">What checks?</h3>
        <p>There are currently 10 different checks that are run over your Django site, and we have plans to add more over time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you disabled DEBUG mode?</li>
            <li>Is your site using HTTPS?</li>
            <li>Can we find your admin site, and is it only accessible through HTTPS?</li>
            <li>Can we find a user login page, and is it only accessible through HTTPS?</li>
            <li>Do you have the CSRF cookie on pages with forms?</li>
            <li>Have you enabled HSTS?</li>
            <li>Have you configured the X-Frame header?</li>
            <li>Is the TRACE HTTP method disabled?</li>
            <li>And more to come...</li>
